# Personal *three.js* playground

**kafei**, or **咖啡** (kāfēi, = coffee), is my *three.js* playground. This website regroups all of my projects and experiments with 3D web development using *three.js*.

---

***three.js*** is a powerful and user-friendly JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of 3D graphics on the web. It builds on top of **WebGL**, a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.
While native WebGL can be complex, requiring developers to manage shaders and low-level details, *three.js* abstracts away much of this complexity, allowing for the creation of stunning 3D scenes with significantly less code.

It's developed by Ricardo Cabello ([Mr.doob](https://github.com/mrdoob)) and an active open-source community. You can find more information and impressive examples on the [official Three.js website](https://threejs.org/).
